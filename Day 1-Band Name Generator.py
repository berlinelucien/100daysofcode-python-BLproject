#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the Band Name Gnerator")

#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city = input("What city did you grow up in?\n") ##we create input with the variable name so it wont get lost in the program, we can recall it later if we need it

#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet = input("Favorite name of a pet?\n")

#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your awesome band name is " + city + " " + pet)

#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line, see the example at:
